# Unhandled Exception in Groovy Closure

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Groovy where exceptions thrown within closures are not properly handled by the calling method, leading to unexpected program termination.

The `bug.groovy` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file shows how to address this issue using try-catch blocks.
